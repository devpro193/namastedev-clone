      "Tbh I found Aryan Bhai inspiring. Before talking to him, I was doing a lot of things together. Java, Python, JavaScript, DSA, R and what not. After our first virtual call, he made a guideline for me to follow. Two simple things that I need to complete within the next one month learn JavaScript and Python fully and build small projects. Itâ€™s been 10 days into following his guidance and I have a better idea of the codes I am writing. His guidance increased my focus and also my interest in learning programming. For someone who is trying to break into tech, Aryan Bhai is a good resource. Before him, I talked to other mentors. Many from the FAANG and all of them were great. What separates him from the others is his interest in seeing you grow and succeed. All of them gave me the same answer but Aryan Bhai is one of the few that responds to your text when you hit a snag.

By the end of the challenge, I noticed significant improvement in my coding proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and overall confidence. Moreover, the sense of accomplishment after completing the challenge was truly gratifying. I highly recommend taking on a 30-day coding challenge to anyone looking to enhance their programming skills and challenge themselves to reach new heights in their coding journey.",

      "Through this mentorship, I've gained invaluable insights, refined my skills, and developed a clearer vision for my career trajectory. The main USP is their 1:1 session, which many big institutes fail to deliver consistently, and the quality of content and customized guidance based on a person's skill set is yet another added advantage. The most liked thing about this community is that mentor's push you to achieve your own goals and create your online presence or identity as well, thereby emphasizing succeeding together. Also, they don't force anyone to take their courses; rather, they motivate one to explore other resources and go with the one suitable for oneself. Be if FAANG/MAANG of any GANG, they would provide you with realistic conditions of the market and different organizations. With all of this package, you get complimentary humor and satirical reels. So, if anyone wants to build in public, I would highly recommend them (Tech main tagde hone pr dhyaan do bs). \n\nThanks a lot for guiding us so far and taking us in your 30DC-verse.\nLastly, there's a suggestion that the mentorship program could be stretched for longer period of time as well.",

You can DM him round the clock with any query, no matter how big or small, and he replies within a few minutes. Now, I don't have to waste time deciding which course to take, which tech stack to learn, or in which order I should cover DSA topics. I just have to complete the tasks given by Aryan bhaiya, and I'm done. Under his guidance, I have already secured an internship of 25k. Now, with my placement in the next 6 months, I'm all set for success under his guidance. Thank you, Aryan bhaiya, for bringing this 1:1 guidance program.",
